# Programmatic Usage

The programmatic APIs allow integrating TSTyche with other tools.

## Requirements

If you plan to use TypeScript, the lowest supported version is `5.4`. The `module` and `moduleResolution` compiler options must be set to `"node16"`.

## Entry Point

The programmatic APIs can be imported from the `tstyche/tstyche` entry point:

```ts
import { Runner } from "tstyche/tstyche";

console.log(Runner.version);
```

## `Runner`

The `tstyche` command is responsible to read configuration and to select test files. That is done before test runner is invoked.

To run the tests, the `Runner` class can be used directly. All you have to do is to provide configuration and list of the test files:

```ts
import { Config, Runner } from "tstyche/tstyche";

const resolvedConfig = Config.resolve();
const runner = new Runner(resolvedConfig);


await runner.run(["./typetests/toBeNumber.tst.ts"]);
```

<Note>

This is consider a power user feature. More documentation may or may not be provided in the future.
