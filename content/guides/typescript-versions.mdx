# TypeScript Versions

TSTyche makes it a breeze to be sure your types are compatible with specific versions of TypeScript.

## Supported Versions

Currently TypeScript `>=5.0` can be used for testing.

<Tip>

Use the [`--list`](../reference/command-line.mdx#list) command line option to inspect the list of supported versions.

</Tip>

## Your Strategy

TSTyche has everything you need to test against specific versions of TypeScript, but which version should you use?

The projects that declare compatibility with TypeScript, mostly choose to specify:

- a single version (only version `x.y` is supported),
- or a range of versions (version `x.y` or above are supported).

### Single Version

Testing against a single version is simple. If the `typescript` package is installed, TSTyche will load it. Otherwise, the latest version of TypeScript will be used.

To specify another version, pass it with the [`--target`](../reference/command-line.mdx#target) command line option or use the [`target`](../reference/config-file.mdx#target) configuration option.

The version of TypeScript used for testing will be reported like this:

```ansi
[34muses[0m TypeScript 5.8.3[90m with ./tsconfig.json[0m
```

### Range of Versions

Keep in mind that TypeScript follows the Semantic Versioning specification only [partly](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/TypeScript's-Release-Process). A patch release is still strictly only a bug fix, but a major release may introduce breaking changes. This means upgrading from `5.6` to `5.7` can break your types.

For instance, if your project declares that the lowest compatible TypeScript version is `5.6`, it is recommended to test against all major versions starting with that one:

```shell
tstyche --target '>=5.6'
```

This command will test using TypeScript `5.6`, `5.7`, `5.8` and so on. The newly released versions will be added as soon as they are available.

The report will include three (or more) versions of TypeScript:

```ansi
[34muses[0m TypeScript 5.6.3[90m with ./tsconfig.json[0m

[34muses[0m TypeScript 5.7.3[90m with ./tsconfig.json[0m

[34muses[0m TypeScript 5.8.3[90m with ./tsconfig.json[0m
```

To learn more about the version ranges, see the [Ranges](../reference/command-line.mdx#ranges) section in the documentation of the `--target` command line option.

<Tip>

Running tests against many versions of TypeScript is slow. Use ranges only in continuous integration workflows. If something fails, run TSTyche locally targeting that single version.

</Tip>

## Handling Changes

Changes between TypeScript versions can be handled using the [`// @tstyche if`](../reference/directives.mdx#if) comment directive:

```ts twoslash
import { expect, test } from "tstyche";

function isUint8Array(target: unknown): target is Uint8Array {
  return target instanceof Uint8Array;
}

test("isUint8Array", () => {
  const unknowns: Array<unknown> = [];

  // @tstyche if { target: ">=5.7" } -- Before TypeScript 5.7, 'Uint8Array' was not generic
  expect(unknowns.filter(isUint8Array)).type.toBe<Array<Uint8Array<ArrayBufferLike>>>();

  // @tstyche if { target: "<5.7" }
  expect(unknowns.filter(isUint8Array)).type.toBe<Array<Uint8Array>>();
});
```

If this directive is used at the top of the file, the whole test file would run only when the specified condition matches.

## Early Warnings

TSTyche supports `beta`, `latest`, `next` or `rc` as the target tags. Use them as one-off commands or in continuous integration workflows.

To catch the breaking changes early, consider setting up a workflow that runs tests once a day against `typescript@next`. A GitHub Actions example can be found in [`tstyche/ts-nightly-example`](https://github.com/tstyche/ts-nightly-example) repository.

<Note>

[`typescript-go`](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go) is not yet supported, but is definitely worth a go! For updates, please follow [tstyche/tstyche#443](https://github.com/tstyche/tstyche/issues/443).

</Note>

## The Store

The TSTyche store is a tiny package manager which knows how to download the requested version of the `typescript` package. It keeps packages in a global cache. This means running TSTyche in a different project will reuse already fetched packages.

To know how to resolve tags like `latest` or `next`, every two hours the store fetches metadata of the `typescript` package from the registry.

These are the command line options dedicated to the store:

- [`--fetch`](../reference/command-line.mdx#fetch) fetches the specified versions of TypeScript, useful if you are preparing to work offline,
- [`--list`](../reference/command-line.mdx#list) prints the list of supported TypeScript versions,
- [`--prune`](../reference/command-line.mdx#prune) removes the whole cache directory, if you want to free up disk space or to resolve a store issue,
- [`--update`](../reference/command-line.mdx#update) force updates the `typescript` package metadata from the registry.
