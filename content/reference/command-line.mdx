# Command Line

TSTyche ships with the `tstyche` command and a set of useful options.

## Usage

When called without arguments, the `tstyche` command runs all test files matched by the [`testFileMatch`](./config-file.mdx#test-file-match) patterns. To select particular files, pass one or more arguments:

```shell
# Run all tests
tstyche

# Only run the matching test file
tstyche query-params

# Test against specific versions of TypeScript
tstyche --target '5.3, 5.5.2, >=5.7'
```

Only the files matched by the [`testFileMatch`](./config-file.mdx#test-file-match) patterns can be selected. The search strings are matched with the portion of the path relative to the current directory. The matching is case insensitive.

<Tip>

If [glob patterns](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)>) are supported in your shell, you can use them as well.

</Tip>

## Options

Options passed through the command line override the ones from the [configuration file](./config-file.mdx).

An option does not take a value, if its type is not specified. Otherwise, the parsing logic of the option value depends on its type:

- **boolean** is interpreted as `true`, if the value is omitted or set to `true`; or as `false`, if set to `false`,
- **string** is simply a string,
- **list** can hold one or several values separated by commas: `--target 4.9` or `--target 4.9,latest`.

Relative paths are resolved relative to the current directory.

<Tip>

Use the [`--showConfig`](#show-config) command line option to inspect the resolved configuration.

</Tip>

### `--config` [#config]

- Type: string

The path to a TSTyche configuration file.

```shell
tstyche --config ./config/tstyche.json
```

### `--failFast` [#fail-fast]

- Type: boolean

Stop running tests after the first failure.

### `--fetch` [#fetch]

Fetch the specified versions of the `typescript` package and exit.

`--fetch` must be used together with the [`target`](./config-file.mdx#target) configuration option or the [`--target`](#target) command line option. The versions specified via the [`--target`](#target) command line option are added, if it is provided; otherwise the versions listed in the [`target`](./config-file.mdx#target) array in the configuration file are added.

```shell
# Fetch TypeScript 4.9.5
tstyche --fetch --target 4.9

# Fetch specific versions of TypeScript
tstyche --fetch --target '5.5, >=5.8'
```

### `--help` [#help]

Print the list of command line options with brief descriptions and exit.

### `--list` [#list]

Print the list of supported versions of the `typescript` package and exit.

### `--listFiles` [#list-files]

Print the list of the selected test files and exit.

### `--only` [#only]

- Type: string

Only run tests with matching name. The given string is matched against the name of every `test()` or `describe()` entry. The matching is case insensitive.

`--only` does not override the [`.skip`](./expect-api.mdx#skip) run mode flag. If both `--only` and [`--skip`](#skip) filters select a test, it gets skipped.

```shell
tstyche --only external
```

### `--prune` [#prune]

Remove all fetched versions the `typescript` package and exit.

### `--plugins` [#plugins]

- Type: list of strings

The list of plugins to use.

The following can be specified:

- name of a package: `"tstyche-plugin"`,
- or a path: `"./custom-plugin.js"`.

```shell
tstyche --plugins tstyche-plugin,./custom-plugin.js
```

To learn more, see the [Plugins](../guides/plugins.mdx) page.

### `--reporters` [#reporters]

- Type: list of strings

The list of reporters to use.

The following can be specified:

- built-in reporter: `"list"` or `"summary"`,
- name of the package: `"tstyche-reporter"`,
- or a path: `"./custom-reporter.js"`.

```shell
tstyche --reporters list,tstyche-reporter,./custom-reporter.js
```

To learn more, see the [Reporters](../guides/reporters.mdx) page.

### `--showConfig` [#show-config]

Print the resolved configuration and exit.

### `--skip` [#skip]

- Type: string

Skip tests with matching name. The given string is matched against the name of every `test()` or `describe()` entry. The matching is case insensitive.

`--skip` overrides the [`.only`](./expect-api.mdx#only) run mode flag. If both `--skip` and [`--only`](#only) filters select a test, it gets skipped.

```shell
tstyche --skip internal
```

### `--target` [#target]

- Type: list of strings

The list of TypeScript versions to be tested on.

The following can be specified:

- `current` is the version of TypeScript currently installed in the project,
- minor releases, like `5.2` or `4.9`, resolves to the latest version in the serries (for example, `4.9` resolves to version 4.9.5),
- patch releases, like `5.3.2` or `4.8.4`,
- `beta`, `latest`, `next` or `rc` distribution [tags](https://npmjs.com/package/typescript?activeTab=versions) of the `typescript` package.

```shell
# Run tests using TypeScript 4.9.5
tstyche --target 4.9

# Run tests using the latest version of TypeScript
tstyche --target latest

# Test against specific versions of TypeScript
tstyche --target '5.0, 5.3.2, next'
```

#### Ranges

Version ranges allow testing on a range of TypeScript versions. The range must be specified using an operator and a minor version.

Supported operators:

- `>`, greater than,
- `>=`, greater than or equal,
- `<`, less than,
- `<=`, less than or equal.

For example, the range `>=5.5` gets expanded to: `5.5`, `5.6`, `5.7` and so on. In the future this list will include newly released versions as well.

To set an upper bound, the intersection of two ranges can be used: `>=5.0 <5.3`. Here only `5.0`, `5.1` and `5.2` are be included.

```shell
# Ranges and versions can be combined
tstyche --target '>=5.0 <5.3, 5.4.2, >5.5'
```

<Tip>

Use the [`--list`](./command-line.mdx#list) command line option to inspect the list of supported versions.

</Tip>

### `--tsconfig` [#tsconfig]

- Type: string

The look up strategy to be used to find the TSConfig file.

The following can be specified:

- `findup`, find the nearest `tsconfig.json` that includes a particular test file,
- `ignore`, do not look for any `tsconfig.json` and use [default compiler options](../project/compiler-options.mdx#default-compiler-options),
- or, if a path is specified, simply load `tsconfig.json` from that path.

```shell
tstyche --tsconfig ./tsconfig.test.json
```

<Warning>

If TSConfig file does not include a test file in question, [default compiler options](../project/compiler-options.mdx#default-compiler-options) are set.

</Warning>

### `--update` [#update]

Fetch the `typescript` package metadata from the registry and exit.

The list of available TypeScript versions is updated every two hours. Use this option, if you want to force the update.

### `--version` [#version]

Print the TSTyche version number and exit.

### `--watch` [#watch]

Watch for changes and rerun related test files. Current implementation is watching the TSTyche configuration file and the test files for changes.

<Note>

Files are watched recursively using the [`fs.watch()`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/fs.html#fswatchfilename-options-listener) method that relies on file system events. In some cases this feature is [not available](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/fs.html#availability). For example, it does not work on network file systems.

</Note>
