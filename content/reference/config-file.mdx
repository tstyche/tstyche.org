# Configuration File

The behavior of TSTyche can be customized through a configuration file.

## Usage

To configure TSTyche add `tstyche.config.json` file to the root of the project. Or point to your configuration file using the [`--config`](./command-line.mdx#config) command line option. The defaults are used, if a configuration file is not provided.

The configuration file must contain an object. Comments, unquoted keys, single quotes or trailing commas are allowed:

```js
{
  // The list of glob patterns to match the test files
  testFileMatch: [
    '**/*.test.ts',
    '**/*.tst.ts',
  ],
}
```

<Note>

For maximum portability, examples on this page follow the [JSON specification](https://json.org/json-en.html).

</Note>

## Schema

In-editor validation can be enabled by adding the `$schema` key:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://tstyche.org/schemas/config.json"
}
```

The below pattern can be used to specify the version of TSTyche:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://tstyche.org/schemas/config-4.1.json"
}
```

## Options

Options passed through the [command line](./command-line.mdx) override the ones from the configuration file.

Relative paths are resolved relative to the configuration file.

<Tip>

Use the [`--showConfig`](./command-line.mdx#show-config) command line option to inspect the resolved configuration.

</Tip>

### `checkDeclarationFiles` [#check-declaration-files]

- Default: `true`
- Type: `boolean`

Check declaration files for type errors.

To maximize performance TSTyche only checks types of test and fixture files. When `checkDeclarationFiles` is enabled, type errors are also reported for declaration and ambient files. In other words, all `.d.ts` files of the projected are checked. The files within the `node_modules` directory are not checked.

It is recommended to enable this option when a project has handcrafted or generated type declarations.

### `checkSuppressedErrors` [#check-suppressed-errors]

- Default: `true`
- Type: `boolean`

Check errors silenced by `// @ts-expect-error` directives in the test files.

When this option is enabled, the runner reads the text after `// @ts-expect-error` and checks if it matches the actual error message:

```ts
// @ts-expect-error  Cannot find name 'add'.
console.log(add);
```

If a message does not match or is not specified, an error is reported.

Use `...` to truncate long error messages:

```ts
// @ts-expect-error  Argument of type ... is not assignable to parameter of type 'never'.
```

To ignore a directive, append the `!` character after it:

```ts
// @ts-expect-error!  This is wrong.
```

### `failFast` [#fail-fast]

- Default: `false`
- Type: `boolean`

Stop running tests after the first failure.

### `fixtureFileMatch` [#fixture-file-match]

- Default: `["**/__fixtures__/*.{ts,tsx}", "**/fixtures/*.{ts,tsx}"]`
- Type: `Array<string>`

The list of glob patterns to match the fixture files. The patterns are matched with the portion of the path relative to the [`rootPath`](#root-path) directory. The matching is case insensitive.

To maximize performance TSTyche only checks types of [test](#test-file-match) and fixture files.

### `rejectAnyType` [#reject-any-type]

- Default: `true`
- Type: `boolean`

Reject the `any` type passed as an argument to the `expect()` function or a matcher.

For instance, the following test is passing even when the return type by mistake resolves to `any`:

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
import { query } from "query";
import { expect } from "tstyche";

expect(query({ payload: "sample" })).type.toBeAssignableTo<string>();
expect(query({ payload: 123 })).type.toBeAssignableTo<number>();
```

This issue can be solved by adding `.not.toBeAny()` check. `rejectAnyType` does the same, but without repetitive boilerplate code.

<Note>

The `any` type is allowed with:

- all matchers when type is explicit, like `.not.toBe<any>()`;
- `.toRaiseError()`, but not `.not.toRaiseError()`.

</Note>

### `rejectNeverType` [#reject-never-type]

- Default: `true`
- Type: `boolean`

Reject the `never` type passed as an argument to the `expect()` function or a matcher.

For instance, the following test is passing even when the `Result` type by mistake resolves to `never`:

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
import { type Result, getResult } from "result";
import { expect } from "tstyche";

expect(getResult("sample")).type.toBe<Result<string>>();
expect(getResult(123)).type.toBe<Result<number>>();
```

This issue can be solved by adding `.not.toBeNever()` check. `rejectNeverType` does the same, but without repetitive boilerplate code.

<Note>

The `never` type is allowed with:

- all matchers when type is explicit, like `.toBeAssignableFrom<never>()`;
- `.toRaiseError()`, but not `.not.toRaiseError()`.

</Note>

### `reporters` [#reporters]

- Default: `["list", "summary"]`
- Type: `Array<string>`

The list of reporters to use.

The following can be specified:

- built-in reporter: `"list"` or `"summary"`,
- name of a package: `"tstyche-reporter"`,
- or a path: `"./custom-reporter.js"`.

```json
{
  "reporters": ["list", "tstyche-reporter", "./custom-reporter.js"]
}
```

To learn more, see the [Reporters](../guides/reporters.mdx) page.

### `rootPath` [#root-path]

- Default: the path to the directory from which the configuration file was loaded or the current directory
- Type: `string`

The path to a directory containing files of a test project.

To collect the test files, the file tree is walked starting from the `rootPath` directory. Later during the test run, the lookup of `tsconfig.json` for each test file starts at the directory containing the file and ends at the `rootPath`.

This means that all test files to be run and TSConfig files to load the compiler configuration from must be within the `rootPath`.

For instance, if you prefer to keep the TSTyche configuration file in a `./config` directory:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="config" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="tstyche.json" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.Folder name="src">
    <FileTree.Folder name="__typetests__">
      <FileTree.File name="MethodLikeKeys.tst.ts" />
      <FileTree.File name="tsconfig.json" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name="MethodLikeKeys.ts" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.File name="package.json" />
  <FileTree.File name="tsconfig.json" />
</FileTree>

The `rootPath` should point to the root of the project:

```json filename="./config/tstyche.json"
{
  "rootPath": "../"
}
```

### `target` [#target]

- Default: `"*"`
- Type: `string`

The range of TypeScript versions to be tested against.

The following can be specified:

- `"*"`, uses the locally installed TypeScript if available, otherwise falls back to the latest version of TypeScript,
- minor releases, like `"5.6"`, resolves to the latest version in the series (for example, `"5.6"` resolves to version 5.6.3),
- patch releases, like `"5.8.2"`,
- `"beta"`, `"latest"`, `"next"` or `"rc"` distribution [tags](https://npmjs.com/package/typescript?activeTab=versions) of the `typescript` package.

To specify multiple versions, provide a single string with versions separated by `||`:

```json
{
  "target": "5.6 || 5.8.2 || latest"
}
```

#### Ranges

Version ranges allow testing on a range of TypeScript versions. The range must be specified using an operator and a minor version.

Supported operators:

- `>`, greater than,
- `>=`, greater than or equal,
- `<`, less than,
- `<=`, less than or equal.

For example, the range `>=5.5` gets expanded to: `5.5`, `5.6`, `5.7` and so on. In the future this list will include newly released versions as well.

To set an upper bound, the intersection of two ranges can be used: `>=5.4 <5.6`. Here only `5.4` and `5.5` are included.

Ranges and versions can be combined:

```json
{
  "target": ">=5.4 <5.6 || 5.6.2 || >=5.7"
}
```

<Tip>

Use the [`--list`](./command-line.mdx#list) command line option to inspect the list of supported TypeScript versions.

</Tip>

### `testFileMatch` [#test-file-match]

- Default: `["**/*.tst.*", "**/__typetests__/*.test.*", "**/typetests/*.test.*"]`
- Type: `Array<string>`

The list of glob patterns to match the test files. The patterns are matched with the portion of the path relative to the [`rootPath`](#root-path) directory. The matching is case insensitive.

Brace expansion of comma separated lists is supported. For example, `["**/tests/*.{ts,tsx}"]` or `["**/tests/*.ts{,x}"]` both expand to `["**/tests/*.ts", "**/tests/*.tsx"]`.

The following wildcards can be used:

- `/` matches a path separator,
- `?` matches any single character excluding path separators,
- `*` matches zero or more characters excluding path separators,
- `**` matches zero or more characters including path separators.

Usage examples:

- `?` can be used to select files or directories that differ in their name by only a character: `typetests/?at.tst.ts` would match `typetests/bat.tst.ts` or `typetests/cat.tst.ts`, but not `typetests/at.tst.ts`,
- `*` can be used to select files within a directory: `*.tst.ts` would match `Options.tst.ts`, but not `Options.test.ts` or `json/Options.tst.ts`,
- `**` can be used to select files within nested directories: `packages/**/typetests/*.test.ts` would match `packages/typetests/api.test.ts`, `packages/core/typetests/awaitable.test.ts` or `packages/parsers/json/typetests/JsonObject.test.ts`.

<Note>

The `?`, `*` and `**` wildcards do not match any path segments that start with the `.` and do not select files within the `node_modules` directories. These files or directories can only be matched if specified explicitly: `**/.generated/*.tst.*` or `node_modules/**/*.tst.*`.

</Note>

<Tip>

Use the [`--listFiles`](./command-line.mdx#list-files) command line option to inspect the list of selected files.

</Tip>

### `tsconfig` [#tsconfig]

- Default: `"findup"`
- Type: `string`

The look up strategy to be used to find the TSConfig file.

The following can be specified:

- `"findup"`, find the nearest `tsconfig.json` that includes a particular test file,
- `"ignore"`, do not look for any `tsconfig.json` and use [default compiler options](../project/compiler-options.mdx#default-compiler-options),
- or, if a path is specified, simply load `tsconfig.json` from that path.

```json
{
  "tsconfig": "./tsconfig.test.json"
}
```

<Warning>

If TSConfig file does not include a test file in question, [default compiler options](../project/compiler-options.mdx#default-compiler-options) are set.

</Warning>
