# Release Notes

This page lists breaking changes and notable new features. Please be sure to read the release notes before upgrading from previous version.

<Note>

The detailed changelog can be found in [TSTyche repository on GitHub](https://github.com/tstyche/tstyche/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

</Note>

## TSTyche 6.0  [#tstyche-6-0]

TSTyche 6.0 ships with a major rewrite of the `.toBe()` matcher. The new implementation compares types by checking their structure. Previously, the internal `.isTypeIdenticalTo()` method of the type checker was used, but that approach will not work with TypeScript 7. The rewrite ensures TSTyche can support TypeScript 7 in the future (to follow updates, subscribe to issue [#443](https://github.com/tstyche/tstyche/issues/443)).

### Requirements

<Warning>

**Breaking!** The minimum supported Node.js version is `22.12`. It is recommended to use the latest [LTS release](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases).

</Warning>

### TypeScript Versions

<Warning>

**Breaking!** The minimum supported TypeScript version is `5.4`. Support for TypeScript `<=5.3` is dropped.

</Warning>

### Matchers

#### `.toBe()` [#to-be]

The new implementation of `.toBe()` brings several improvements to the matcher. It considers the following types as identical:

- `{ a: string } & { b: number }` and `{ a: string; b: number }`;
- `((a: string) => string) & ((b: number) => number)` and `{ (a: string): string; (b: number): number }`.

Previously ignored, `this` parameters, `const` type parameters or `NoInfer` markers are now taken into account:

- `(this: unknown) => void` is not `() => void`;
- `<const T>(arg: T) => T` is not `<T>(arg: T) => T`;
- `<T>(arg: NoInfer<T>) => T` is not `<T>(arg: T) => T`.

<Tip>

All of the above works with any complexity and at any depth.

</Tip>

### Plugins

<Warning>

Support for plugins is removed. Most of use cases should be covered by the [comment directives](../reference/directives.mdx).
