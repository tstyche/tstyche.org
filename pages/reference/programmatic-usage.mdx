# Programmatic Usage

The programmatic APIs allow integrating TSTyche with other tools like code editors or Git providers.

<Warning>

This is a **work in progress feature** and it is not recommended for production. Breaking changes will ship between minor versions.

</Warning>

## Requirements

If you plan to use TypeScript, the lowest supported version is `5.x`. The `module` and `moduleResolution` compiler options must be set to `"node16"`.

## Entry Point

The programmatic APIs can be imported from the `tstyche/tstyche` entry point (available only in ESM):

```ts
import * as tstyche from "tstyche/tstyche";

console.log(tstyche.TSTyche.version);
```

<Note>

This is consider a power user feature. More documentation may or may not be provided in the future.
