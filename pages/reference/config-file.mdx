# Configuration File

The behavior of TSTyche can be customized through a configuration file.

## Usage

To configure TSTyche add `tstyche.config.json` file to the root of the project. Or point to the configuration file using the [`--config`](./command-line.mdx#config) command line option. The defaults will be used if the configuration file is not provided.

The configuration file must contain an object. Comments are allowed:

```json
{
  // The list of glob patterns to match the test files
  "testFileMatch": ["**/*.test.ts", "**/*.tst.ts"]
}
```

<Note>

The compiler configuration is loaded from the nearest `tsconfig.json` file. To learn more, see the [Project Setup](../guide/project-setup.mdx) page.

</Note>

## Schema

In-editor validation can be enabled by adding the `$schema` key to the configuration file:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://tstyche.org/schemas/config.json"
  // ...
}
```

The below pattern can be used to specify the version of TSTyche:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://tstyche.org/schemas/config-1.0.json"
  // ...
}
```

## Options

Options passed through the [command line](./command-line.mdx) override the ones from the configuration file.

<Tip>

Use the [`--showConfig`](./command-line.mdx#show-config) command line option to inspect the resolved configuration.

</Tip>

### `allowNoTestFiles` [#allow-no-test-files]

- Default: `false`
- Type: `boolean`

Do not raise an error, if no test files are selected.

### `failFast` [#fail-fast]

- Default: `false`
- Type: `boolean`

Stop running tests after the first failure.

### `rootPath` [#root-path]

- Default: the path to the directory from which the configuration file was loaded or the current directory
- Type: `string`

The path to a directory containing files of a test project. Relative path is resolved relative to the configuration file.

To collect the test files, the file tree is walked starting from the `rootPath` directory. Later during the test run, the lookup of `tsconfig.json` for each test file starts at the directory containing the file and ends at the `rootPath`.

This means that all test files to be run and TSConfig files to load the compiler configuration from must be within the `rootPath`.

For instance, if you prefer to keep the TSTyche configuration file in a `./config` directory:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="config" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="tstyche.json" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.Folder name="src">
    <FileTree.Folder name="__typetests__">
      <FileTree.File name="MethodLikeKeys.tst.ts" />
      <FileTree.File name="tsconfig.json" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name="MethodLikeKeys.ts" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.File name="package.json" />
  <FileTree.File name="tsconfig.json" />
</FileTree>

The `rootPath` should point to the root of the package repository:

```json filename="./config/tstyche.json"
{
  "rootPath": "../"
}
```

### `target` [#target]

- Default: `["latest"]`
- Type: `Array<string>`

The list of TypeScript versions to be tested on.

You can target minor `"x.y"` or patch `"x.y.z"` releases. The `"x.y"` tag resolves to the latest version in the serries (e.g. passing `"4.9"` resolves to version 4.9.5).

The `"beta"`, `"latest"`, `"next"` and `"rc"` tags are supported. To run tests on the currently installed version of TypeScript version, pass `"current"`:

```json
{
  "target": ["4.9", "current"]
}
```

### `testFileMatch` [#test-file-match]

- Default: `["**/*.tst.*", "**/__typetests__/*.test.*", "**/typetests/*.test.*"]`
- Type: `Array<string>`

The list of glob patterns to match the test files. The patterns are matched relative to the [`rootPath`](#root-path) directory.

The following wildcards can be used:

- `*` matches zero or more characters (excluding directory separators),
- `?` matches any one character (excluding directory separators),
- `**/` matches any directory nested to any level.

If the last segment in a pattern does not contain a file extension or wildcard character, it is treated as a directory and all files inside that directory are selected.

<Tip>

Use the [`--listFiles`](./command-line.mdx#list-files) command line option to inspect the list of selected files.
