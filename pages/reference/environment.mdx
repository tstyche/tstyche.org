# Environment Variables

TSTyche must know few details about the environment before starting. These can be set using the environment variables.

## Options

The parsing logic of the option value depends on its type:

- **boolean** is interpreted as `true`, if set to `1`, `on`, `t`, `true`, `y` or `yes`; otherwise `false`,
- **number** is normalized using the [`Number()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/Number) constructor,
- **string** as expected, is simply a string.

<Warning>

Values of the environment variables are not validated, meaning that they are passed around as provided without any additional checks.

</Warning>

<Tip>

Use the [`--showConfig`](./command-line.mdx#show-config) command line option to inspect the resolved configuration.

### `TSTYCHE_NO_COLOR` [#no-color]

- Default: `false`; or `true`, if the [`NO_COLOR`](https://no-color.org) environment variable is set and the value is not an empty string.
- Type: boolean

Specifies whether color should be disabled in the output.

### `TSTYCHE_STORE_PATH` [#store-path]

- Default: `$HOME/Library/TSTyche` on macOS; or `%LocalAppData%/TSTyche` on Windows, if the `LocalAppData` environment variable is set; or `$XDG_DATA_HOME/TSTyche` on Linux, if the `XDG_DATA_HOME` environment variable is set; otherwise `$HOME/.local/share/TSTyche`.
- Type: string

The directory where the installed versions of the `typescript` package are stored. Relative path is resolved relative to the current directory.

### `TSTYCHE_TIMEOUT` [#timeout]

- Default: `30`
- Type: number

The number of seconds to wait before giving up stale operations. The value of `0` disables the timeout.

The timeout value is passed to the request to fetch the `typescript` package metadata from the registry and to the process spanned to run the `npm install` command, which installs the requested version of the package.
