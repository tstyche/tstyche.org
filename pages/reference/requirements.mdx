# System Requirements

TSTyche requires Node.js and internet connection.

## TypeScript

TypeScript `4.x` and `5.x` can be used for testing.

## Node.js

It is recommended to use the most recent Active Long Term Support (LTS) version. The minimum required Node.js version is `14.17`.

TSTyche supports and tests only the LTS releases of Node.js. Other releases might work too, but keep in mind that not LTS releases are not ready for general use.

The details regarding Node.js release schedule are available [on GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule).

## Internet Connection

TSTyche uses `npm` registry and command to install requested versions of the `typescript` package. Therefor to run tests on not yet used TypeScript version requires internet connection.

From time to time [the store](../guide/test-runner.mdx#the-store) fetches the latest metadata from the registry to update the manifest. This makes sure that tags like `latest` or `next` resolve correctly.
