# System Requirements

TSTyche requires Node.js and internet connection.

## TypeScript

TypeScript `4.x` and `5.x` can be used for testing.

## Node.js

The minimum required Node.js version is `^16.14`, or `18.x`, or `20.x`. It is recommended to use the most recent [Active LTS version](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule).

## Internet Connection

TSTyche uses `npm` registry and command to install requested versions of the `typescript` package. Therefor to run tests on not yet used TypeScript version requires internet connection.

From time to time [the store](../guide/test-runner.mdx#the-store) fetches the latest metadata from the registry to update the manifest. This makes sure that tags like `latest` or `next` resolve correctly.
