# System Requirements

TSTyche requires Node.js and internet connection.

## TypeScript

TypeScript `4.x` and `5.x` can be used for testing.

## Node.js

The minimum required Node.js version is `16.14`. It is recommended to use the latest Long Term Support (LTS) release.

Testing on specific version of TypeScript requires Node.js 18 or later. The global [`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) method is now used to fetch the `typescript` package metadata from the registry.

TSTyche supports and tests only the LTS releases of Node.js. Other releases might work too, but keep in mind that only the LTS releases are considered ready for general use.

The details regarding Node.js release schedule are available [on GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule).

## Internet Connection

TSTyche uses the `npm` registry and command to install requested versions of the `typescript` package. Therefor testing on not yet used TypeScript version requires internet connection.

From time to time [the store](../guide/test-runner.mdx#the-store) fetches the latest metadata from the registry to update the manifest. This makes sure that tags like `latest` or `next` resolve correctly.
