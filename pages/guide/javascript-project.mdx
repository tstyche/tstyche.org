# JavaScript Project

A project without a TSConfig file and TypeScript installed in this guide is referred as a JavaScript project.

This can be a JavaScript library which ships with handcrafted type definitions. To make testing the definitions a breeze, TSTyche sets sensible default compiler options and provides the `typescript` package.

<Tip>

If your project includes TSConfig file and TypeScript is installed, you should follow the [TypeScript Project](./typescript-project.mdx) guide.

</Tip>

## Default Compiler Options

If a project does not have a `tsconfig.json` or a particular test file is not included in any of TSConfig files found in enclosing directories, TSTyche will set the following compiler options:

```jsonc
{
  "allowImportingTsExtensions": true, // not set for TypeScript 4.x
  "allowJs": true,
  "checkJs": true,
  "esModuleInterop": true,
  "jsx": "preserve",
  "module": "esnext", // "preserve" for TypeScript >=5.4
  "moduleResolution": "bundler", // "node" for TypeScript 4.x
  "resolveJsonModule": true,
  "strictFunctionTypes": true,
  "strictNullChecks": true,
  "target": "esnext"
}
```

<Note>

Your code editor may have set different default compiler options. This is the reason why TSTyche might see typings different than the editor. If that is an issue, add a `tsconfig.json` file to a project and it will be used by both TSTyche and the editor.

</Note>

## TypeScript Version

If TypeScript is not installed in a project, TSTyche will add the `latest` version of the `typescript` package to [the store](./test-runner.mdx#the-store) and will use it for type testing.

To specify another version of TypeScript, pass it with the [`--target`](../reference/command-line.mdx#target) command line option or use the [`target`](../reference/config-file.mdx#target) configuration option.
