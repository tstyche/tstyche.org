# Introduction

TSTyche is a type test runner that was created to handle hundreds of type test in large monorepos. While that was the initial problem, TSTyche is easy to use with small projects too.

## Goals of the Project

TSTyche is build to test projects of any size and complexity. It aims to be:

- lightweight
- performant
- predictable
- scalable

## The Name

The name of TSTyche is abbreviated from TypeScript **ty**pe **che**ck. In the early stage of development the library was defined as a type checker. Later it became a type test runner, but the name remained.

In Greek mythology, [Tyche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyche) was the goddess of fortune and prosperity.
