# Introduction

TSTyche is a type testing tool that was created to handle hundreds of type test in large monorepos. While that was the initial motivation, TSTyche is very easy to use with small projects too.

## Goals of the Project

TSTyche is build to test projects of any size and complexity. It aims to be:

- lightweight
- performant
- predictable
- scalable

## Why TSTyche?

Take a look at any popular JavaScript test runner. It will be a command line tool. It will have `test()` and `describe()` helpers with `.only` and `.skip` modifiers. It will be able to select test files using a pattern or to run a specific test file. And it will output failures in red, success in green and warnings in yellow (like traffic lights).

As expected, TSTyche does all of above. Also since it is a type test runner, TSTyche is able to test using specific TypeScript version or even version range: `tstyche --target '>=5.0 <5.3'`.

## Why a Type Test Runner?

You might think that TypeScript has all necessary tools. Alright, let’s look inside.

The `typescript` package consists of the compiler or `tsc`, and the language server or `tsserver`. Both of them wrap around the same type checking API. `tsc` is called from the command line, it emits code and reports found errors in red. `tsserver` provides information for text editors and reports found errors in red.

The `tstyche` command is the third member of this team. It wraps around the same type checking APIs. But instead of emitting code or feeding text editors, it provides type testing experience and reports in the three colors of traffic lights.

Would you like to use `test()` and `describe()` in your tests? Would you like to see green `pass` printed next to a test file name? Would you like to test your types against several versions of TypeScript?

TSTyche was created, because its author wanted to have a type test runner with all these features. (And more.)

## How TSTyche Works?

To be able to test types TSTyche loads the `typescript` package installed in your project. It checks types programmatically and does not require any dependencies to be installed. This is why the install size of TSTyche is just above 200kB.

TSTyche wraps around TypeScript’s [language service API](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Using-the-Language-Service-API) that is designed to do the absolute minimum work required to answer a query. If only a single test file is selected for a run, there is no need to waste time to type check the whole program.

The language service API is also used by text editors like Visual Studio Code. This means that TSTyche sees exactly the same types which you see in hover messages.

## The Name

The name of TSTyche is abbreviated from TypeScript **ty**pe **che**ck. In the early stage of development the library was defined as a type checker. Later it became a type test runner, but the name remained.

In Greek mythology, [Tyche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyche) was the goddess of fortune and prosperity.
